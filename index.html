            <p>It turns out that roughly 68% of the universe is dark energy. Dark matter makes up about 27%.
              The rest - everything on Earth, everything ever observed with all of our instruments,
              all normal matter - adds up to less than 5% of the
              universe.</p>

              Its gravitational effects are necessary to explain the rotation of galaxies,
              the motions of clusters, and the largest scale-structure in the entire Universe.
              ... Without dark matter, the Universe would likely have no signs of life at all.</p>

              instruments. But scientists are confident it exists because of the gravitational effects
              it appears to have on galaxies and galaxy clusters.</p>

      <p>The universe came into existence after the big bang and everything observable in the universe
        after then, be it the stars,planets or anything else are made up of only 7% of the universe's
        particles that is observable and detected so far. But there is an another type of matter which
        makes up almost 27% of the uviverse but we can
        neither see it nor feel its presence.This matter is called the DARK MATTER. Scientists believe in it's existence
        and strongly advocate that this stuff makes it possible for galaxies to exist.Even the universe is
        structured in such a way that it seems not enough for the gravity of the normal matter to sustain the structure
        of the universe we know today.The stars would have been scattered in all places rather than forming galaxies
        and hence it is concluded that there is something present around them, something which neither emits light
        nor reflect light,something dark, something beyond our observation .</p>
      <br>
      <p>Some scientists say that places having high cocentration of dark matter bend the light passing through them.
        Though we are not so sure for what the dark matter actually is but we do have an idea that it is unique
        and differentiates itself from other known matters and particles. Some even claimed earlier that it may
        be like anti matter to some extent but in reality it is not. Dark matter can not be like anti matter
        because we do have an idea that the dark matter surrounds normal matter and if in case it was somewhat
        like the anti matter then it would have reacted with the matters emitting gamma rays.It is also not in
        the form of clouds otherwise it would have emitted particals that we would detect.
        Basically what we know about it is that:
        1. There is something.
        2. It interacts with gravity.
        3. There is lot of it.</p>
      <br>
      Dark matter is probably made up of a complicated exotic particle that does not interact with light and
      matter in a way we expect.
      A scientist simulated two models of universe,one with enough dark matter and one with very little dark matter.
      In the first case stars were readily formed and they came closer to form
      clusters and then they formed galaxies while in the other universe the stars took very long time to
      form as compared to the first galaxy.This also proves the existence of the dark matter. Fritz Zwiscky,
      a Swiss astronomer, was the first to suspect the existence of dark matter in 1933.
      This matter of an unknown type generated a gravitational force without emitting light.
      Hence it is named as "Dark Matter".
